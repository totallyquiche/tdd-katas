# TDD Katas

## Overview

This repo contains my implementations of various TDD katas, programming exercises
intended to reinforce the skill of Test-Driven Development through practice and
repetition.

## Katas

### String Calculator ([source](https://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1))

Tests a class whose primary function is to find the sum of numbers inputted as a
deliminated string.

* [JavaScript solution](./string-calculator/javascript)

### Bowling Game ([source](https://kata-log.rocks/bowling-game-kata))

Tests a bowling game module which allows for rolling the ball and getting the current score.

* [JavaScript solution](./bowling-game/javascript)

### Stack ([source](https://www.codurance.com/katas/stack))

Tests a `stack` data structure (last-in-first-out). The class methods do not rely on built-in langauge methods for typical stack behavior (e.g. `push`, `pop`).

* [JavaScript solution](./stack/javascript)
